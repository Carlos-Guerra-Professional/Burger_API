My Burger API
This is a sample API built for learning purposes. I followed an online tutorial in order to dable in and gain experience building my first API. The tutorial is located at https://youtu.be/FLnxgSZ0DG4  

The author of this API is Ania Kubow. You can find her github repository for this burger api at https://github.com/kubowania/burger-api

But, viewing this from a Computer Scientist perspective, an API is really nothing more than a multi-level hashmap that receives it's data from a database the majority of the time.
